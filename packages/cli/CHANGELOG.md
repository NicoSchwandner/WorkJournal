# work-journal

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ea8774: Change journal directory to lowercase for better filesystem compatibility

### Patch Changes

- b8c4204: Warn once for non-canonical Templates folder
- e7df432: Fixes a bug where the config file could be written inside the Templates/ folder (instead of the project root) if the folder was named with a capital T ("Templates/").

  The project root is now always resolved correctly regardless of the case of the templates folder, so config files are saved in the right place. Also adds a test for PascalCase folder names and ensures cross-platform path compatibility.
