description: README must be updated whenever user-facing behaviour changes
globs:
  # Any CLI command, flag or help text
  - 'packages/cli/src/commands/**/*.ts'
  # Any new or modified template that may add placeholders
  - 'templates/**/*_template.md'
  # The README itself
  - 'README.md'

### Rule

When you **add, rename, or change** any of the following, you _must_ also update `README.md` in the same change set:

1. **CLI sub-commands** (files in `packages/cli/src/commands/`)
2. **CLI flags / options** declared via `yargs.options()`
3. **Template placeholders** (e.g. `$sprint`, `$goal`) or the placeholder list itself
4. **Folder conventions or file paths** a user has to know (`Journal/yyyy/MM/...`, etc.)
5. **Installation / build instructions** (Node version bump, new env var, etc.)

#### README update checklist

- **Quick-Start examples** still run without errors (`npx work-journal new` etc.).
- **Placeholder reference table** contains the new placeholder with an example.
- **Feature table** in the README’s “Features” section reflects the new capability
  (use ☑️ for delivered features, 🏗 for in progress).
- If a change is a **breaking behavioural change**, mention it under a
  `### 💥 Breaking` heading (the release workflow will propagate it to the changelog).

> Skip README edits **only** if the code change is strictly internal and has **zero** impact on any user-visible behaviour.
