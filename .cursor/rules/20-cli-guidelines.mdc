### Command registration  
```ts
yargs.command(
  '<name>',
  '<description>',
  builder => { /* options */ },
  handler => { /* impl */ }
)
```

* Put each sub-command in `src/commands/<name>.ts`.
* Export a pure function; no side effects at import time (improves unit-testability).
* For new flags, update auto-generated help via `yargs.showHelp()`.

### Date logic

Use helpers from `src/lib/dateLogic.ts`.
Do **not** call `date-fns` directly inside commands; keep calculations centralised for easier testing.

### Editor launch

`--open` flag resolves `$EDITOR` â†’ falls back to `code`.
Never assume VS Code is installed globally; catch spawn errors and log a path hint instead.
